I'm just learning to git. 
It works! 
<br>Cool.

Beavis Call Center Image is probably the property of MTV or Mike Judge or Disney.
Watermark from http://90skid.com 
Discovered by searching for Office Stock Photos on Ask Jeeves Search Engine.
Which lead me to Boogle Images.
Downloaded Image by following these 8 steps:
1. right clicking
2. save image as
3. "Call Canter Beavis giphy.gif"
4. Spending twenty minutes trying to figure out why git add would not work. 
5. Throwing phone at wall.
6. Googling
7. Stack Overflowing
8. Realizing "Center" was spelled "Canter"
9. Ohhh.


<br>Rad.
